            	<p><b style="font-size:20px; color: #900;">Due to covid-19 pandemic situation, the organization committees of PDCAT and PAAP decide to hold the conferences jointly this year.</b></p><br>
                
                <p>The steering committee, program, and organization chairs of PDCAT and PAAP are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation. The conference will be a mix of physical and virtual attendance. Our community's health and safety are our priority: attending the physical meeting and giving the talks will be safe. A virtual presence will be possible in case of remaining safety concerns or travel restrictions. The authors of the accepted papers will have the choice to attend the conference virtually.</p>

                The Joint International Conference PDCAT-PAAP 2020, the <b style="color:#33F">21st</b> International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT’20) and the <b style="color:#33F">11th</b> International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming (PAAP’20), will be held in Shenzhen, China during December 28-30, 2020. 
</p><br><p>
The International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT) and International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming (PAAP) are major forums for scientists, engineers, and practitioners throughout the world to present the latest research, results, ideas, developments and applications in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing, parallel architectures, algorithms and programming techniques. We devoutly wish participants to learn the basic theory of a gradual approach, practical experimental data, new business models, and the latest academic trends from this conference. During these 20 years, PDCAT and PAAP had been successfully held in many countries including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand across Asia-Oceania.
</p><br><p>
PDCAT-PAAP 2020 will be organized by Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIAT) and National Supercomputing Center in Shenzhen (NSCCSZ). SIAT focuses on the multi-disciplinary integration development of Information Technology and Biotechnology. SIAT aims to enhance the innovative capacity of the equipment manufacturing and service industries in the Guangdong-Hong Kong region, promote the development of emerging industries possessing their own proprietary intellectual property, and become a world-class industrial research institute. NSCCSZ is a major scientific and technological infrastructure project in Shenzhen with largest single investment since the establishment of the city. It belongs to the National 863 Program, and is also an important project both in Guangdong Province and Shenzhen. NSCCSZ is located in Guangdong Province, an area neighbouring Hong Kong and Macao, which is at the forefront of China’s reform and opening up.
