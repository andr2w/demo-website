                The conference proceedings will be published in Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) with Springer. CCIS is abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, Scopus. Papers reporting original and unpublished research results and experience are solicited. Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Papers must be written in English without exceeding 12 pages in length. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer. Each paper will be reviewed by at least 3 prominent researchers who are conversant in parallel computing and information security. Extended versions of selected papers will be recommended to special issues of some SCI-indexed international journals. The tentative journals include Tsinghua Science and Technology, Computers and Electrical Engineering, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, Computer Science and Information Systems, IEEE Access.
